# Frontend Developer Guide

Navigation to rules, workflows, and skills.

## Architecture Constraints

**[`frontend-architecture.md`](../rules/frontend-architecture.md)** - FSD structure, tech stack, type safety, quality rules

## Workflows

- **`/add-feature`** - Create new feature (step-by-step)
- **`/pre-commit`** - Validation before commit
- **`/communication`** - Collaboration standards

## Skills

### Code Quality

- **`frontend-code-review`** - FSD/translation/type validation scripts

### Testing

- **`testing`** - Unit/Integration/E2E (Vitest, MSW, Playwright)

### Development

- **`contextual-translations`** - Human-quality i18n
- **`readme-update`** - README maintenance

## Quick Start

**New feature**: Agent uses `/add-feature` → calls skills as needed

**Pre-commit**: Agent uses `/pre-commit` → runs validation scripts
